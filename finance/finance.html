					<p>This is the last homework for the Harvard Class CS50. This project uses html, css, python and flask (rather 
						than javascript) to make a mock financial website. The data is stored in SQL databases and passwords are 
						encrypted.  
						<br />
						<br />
						This website allows users to register a username with a password. They can then log onto their account where they will
						find $10,000. They can get stock qoutes, buy and sell stocks, and view their buy/sell history. Unfortunately the $10,000
						isn't real, but the stock qoutes and prices are requested from a real time API.
						<br />
						<br />
						I was really hoping to have a link to the website so viewers could test it out for themselves. Unfortunately,
						github doesn't host flask applications. I am working with PythonAnywhere to get the site hosted but just haven't yet worked through 
						the technical issues.
