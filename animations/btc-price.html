					These animations are made with python and matplotlib. They all use data called from API's to display bitcoin data through time. These animations were inspired by 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@wickedsmartbitcoin" target="_blank">Wicked Smart Bitcoin</a> who makes the best animations in the game. Definitely worth checking out 
					his youtube channel. 
					<br />
					<br />

					I learned a lot about python, matplotlib, calling APIs, reading API documentation, parsing JSON data and manipulating datasets. It also taught me about the headaches of finding reliable, free 
					data. I found that I spent a large portion of my time searching for data sets to use which was frustrating because I really wanted to be finishing more animations 
					with more complex features. I am really surprised that bitcoin data is not more available, seeing that the bitcoin ledger is a free, open source database. 				
					<br />
					<br />
					
					<b>Disclaimer: </b>3 of the animations use an API from the same site which was missing 5 months of bitcoin data (Oct 2020-march 2021) at the time of the recording.
					The data is otherwise accurate but the missing months is painfully obvious in the animations. I hope to find a better API soon. Open to suggestions!

					<p>This animations plots the purchase price of Bitcoin Vs Microsoft Corporation. It is amazing to see one of the most highly regarded, blue chip stocks
					look completely flat compared to Bitcoin over the past 9 years. I think a log scale would look a bit more interesting to observe.

					<p>Unlike the US Dollar, Bitcoins' supply issuance is mathematically programmed into the protocol making a monetary policy that is incredibly predictable and stable. In this chart the stationary 
						blue and red lines are the mathematical predictions for bitcoin supply and annualized inflation rate, respectively. The orange and the green lines are the cooresponding 
						real time data. 
						<br />
						I find it incredible that the mathematical predictions are playing out in reality. I think this is great chart for anyone concerned that the 21 million supply cap
						 of bitcoin is not credible. This shows that the supply is following the planned path to asymptomatically approaching 21 Million.

					<p>Bitcoin as a Store of Value: This graph tracks the change in a handful of assets verse bitcoin. In other words, we are using bitcoin as a baseline to measure the 
						assets. The assets are: MSFT stock, S&P500, Gold, Real Estate, US Dollar, and the Turkish Lira. MSFT lost more than 90% of its purchasing power and the Turkish Lira 
						lost more than 99% of its purchasing power against bitcoin. S&P500, Gold, Real Estate and US Dollar are all between 97-99% loss.
