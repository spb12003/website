# Portfolio Website
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
	My Final Project for CS50 is a personal portfolio website, hosted by github, alogn with two simple projects that are displayed on the website. 
	I plan to continue my computer science education and pursue my own personal projects so making a website where I can display my work was already something 
	I wanted to do. So I used this final project opportunity to get started on a foundation I plan to build on.

	So, this final project is three parts: Portfolio Website, Clock Project, and Calculator Project. I will describe them individually.

	Portfolio Website: https://spb12003.github.io/shawnburns.github.io/
		This website (currently still a work in progress) is a site where I will display my future coding work. Currently, it has links to two projects (very simple ones) and hopefully I can 
		add many more (of higher complexity) in the future. The website functions like most others with different pages, buttons, tabs ect. The two projects found under the home page 
		have buttons that will take the user to the source code and (for the calculator) to the project website. 

		 Languages and Modules Used:
		 	- html, css, js

		Challenges/Learning Experiences/Ect:
			- I used a website template I found online (https://html5up.net/massively) to get started. I don't know if that is cheating or not but the template provided me with
			 html, css and js and I went through the files and changed what was necessary. I have a lot more customizing to do. 
			- To complete this project, I first had to set up Visual Code Studio on my own computer as well as create a github account. Uploading the files to a github repository 
			 and creating a github pages to host the website was new to me. So that was a learning process and will be valuable infomation going forward.
			

	Clock Project:
		This porject displays six digital clocks at different time zones. It starts with the users current location and has
		five other locations around the world.

		Main Features:
			-Opens GUI
			-Displays times locally and in 5 different cities around the world

		Languages and Modules Used:
			-python
				modules: 
					- tkinter: Used to build and manipulate the GUI
					- pytz: Used the function timezone() to calculate the different time zones of the citys
					- datetime: used calculate the local time and time on other zones

		Challenges/Learning Experiences:
			-This one is silly but very time consuming. For a long time I was looking for a way to directly embed this python script 
			into my webpage portfolio. I was thinking I would have a buttonon the website that would launch the GUI and show off the final 
			product. Apparently, thats not how a tkinter GUI works. One would have to download it... I'm still looking for information on this 
			subject but for now I settle for linking to my source code in github repositories. I wish I had time to display it bettor on the website. 
			Maybe I will figure it out later in my education. 
				-I was trying to implement flask without success.

			- Getting the different time for different zone was a learning experience. I didnt realize I needed to use pytz modules

			- This was my first time using tkinter so I learned a lot about GUI use 


	Calculator Project
		This project is a webpage displaying a home made calculator with normal calculator functions.

		Main Features:
			- performs simple calculations
			- contains common built in functions such as square, square root, plus, minus, and other mathematical functions. 

		Languages Used:
			-html
			-javascript
			-css

		Challenges/Learning Experiences:
			- this was a very simple project that allowed me to get a bit more familiar with the html, js and css
			- I could spend much longer putting all sorts of fancy bells and whistles into my calculator
			but I just decided to get it to a functioning state and to move on to more interesting projects
			- I found myself very bored with this project due to the mundane nature of the results as well as the repetition of creating the html and js
			- There are still some bugs that could be fixed
