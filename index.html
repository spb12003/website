							<h2>About Shawn</h2>
							<p>
								
								<br />
								<br />
								After spending my childhood in CT, I attended University of Connecticut. In 2017 I graduated 
								with a BS in Civil Engineering, I started a full time engineering job with a company called Electric Boat General 
								Dynamics; a contractor that engineers and builds nuclear powered submarines for the US Navy.
								<br />
								<br />
								I spent 2.5 years doing finite element structural analysis on internal structures in the reactor compartment. This was 
								great engineering experience but out of curiosity for other opportunites, in mid 2019 I switched to another department that did 
								structural analysis and project management. It was another good experience to see the project management side of things and I 
								was able to be quite helpful with my FEA experience. 
								<br />
								<br />
								In September, 2020 I decided to leave the safety of my corporate job to pursue a full time real estate career. I had learned the idea 
								of rental properties and desired the "freedom" of being self employed. From the end of 2020 to early 2023 I worked full time as a real estate 
								agent, deal finder, and landlord, meeting some success any many failures along the way. Also, in 2021 I worked part time
								for a local land surveying company called J Demspey Associates. I was interested in the opportunity because it aligned with my real estate
								interests as well as my desires to run my own business. This was another great learning opportunity with an amazing team. However, 
								I couldn't find a passion for the work and decided to stop by early 2022. 
								<br />
								<br />
								Through out 2020 and 2021 I continued to question what was happening in the real estate market. How is it possible that 
								the prices of homes and properties are skyrocketing while half of the economy is closed down? This line of questioning lead me
								to rediscover bitcoin. 
								<br />
								<br />
							    In the end of 2016 I was first introduded to Bitcoin. I hadn't even purchased my first stock at that point and had very little money as it was 
								my last year of college. Didn't do any proper research just knew my friends had "made money" so I dove in with both feet. That lead to me buying bitcoin
								and all sorts of altcoins nonesense through 2017 into 2018. I forgot about the entire space for a few years as I became obsessed with real estate
								investing. 
								<br />
								<br />
								I slowly started to research the history of money, bitcoin and the network, and the current financial system, picking up in earnest in the middle of 2022. By April 2023
								I couldn't focus on real estate anymore and started extracting myself from the industry. In my research, I had gone from thinking bitcoin was an interesting investment, 
								to understanding it as having the potential of gold, to thinking of it as an amazing assymetric bet, to realizing it is a genuine step change in the technology of money
								and it is a potential solution to one of the biggest problems in the world today: an extractive global monetary system. 
								<br />
								<br />
								By the middle of 2023 I decided to take time off to learn more about computer science and to continue studying bitcoin and money. I decided to start learning computer science
								1. because I wanted to look at bitcoin from a more technical lense, and 2. becuase I wanted to make myself useful in the bitcoin related industries. These last 7 months have been 
								such a treat to be a full time student. I learned a lot about coding and the bitcoin network, however, for both of these subjects I know I am just scratching the surface.
								<br />
								<br />
								I still do believe owning bitcoin is a positively assymetric proposition. But what makes me so obsessed and optimistic about bitcoin is the potential possitive impact the technology
								can have on the world. 
								<br />
								<br />
								At the risk of sounding hyperbolic I confess that I see Bitcoin as much more than an investment asset (or more accurately long term savings).
								I believe this tool gives users certain freedoms and property rights that are physically difficult for anyone else to infringe on. I believe that once this tool can be addopted as humans global monetary system;
								it could create a peroid of prosperity for humans by decreasing the profitability of violence and allowing the productivity gains of technology to be distrubuted 
								to society in the form of lower prices. 
								<br />
								<br />
								These are a few of the reasons why I am now seeking job oportunities with companies that are focusing on building on (or with) Bitcoin. I find the subject of money 
								endlessly fascinating but I also see the mission of perpetuating the bitcoin technology through society as an incredibly valuable way to spend my time and 
								a great place to continue my career. 
								<br />
								<br />
								If you have made it this far, thank you very much for your time. Feel free to reach out. I am always happy to connect!
